<h3>It went a little like this,</h3>

        <h5>Week One: May 29th - June 1st</h5>
        <p>I mostly fumbled around getting accounts set up, moving in to
 my dorm.  Oh, by the way, you probably want to
         take their advice and live
        in the dorms.  The campus is not car friendly, the parking is 
outrageously expensive during the daytime, and the parking misers will
        give you $40 tickets. :( In fact, if you're not going to have 
your car, at
        least have a bike, you're going to have to go to Wal-Mart 
eventually.
        They picked you out some dorms that are within walking distance 
to everything you need.</p>
      
        By the way, I've programmed studBud1000 here to reprogram himself, be afraid. Be very afraid.

        Ok. I'm kidding, studBud1000 is just a toy, he can't actually write code. <br>

        <h5>Week Two: June 4th - June 8th</h5>        
        <p>
        I spent most of this week discussing motion planning with the 
grad students. They were all eager to help. I also practiced my Linux-Fu
        and learned how to use a scripting language called LaTeX for 
publishing
        mad documents. GUIs are heavy and bulky, but my Linux Fu is 
light like a
        feather.

        <br><br>
        
        It appears that studBud1000 has a runtime error...

        </p><center>
        <img src="entries.php_files/studBud2.jpg" alt="fix it studBud1000!" width="480" height="287" border="0" align="middle">

        <p></p>

        </li>
    
    <li class="three">
        <h5>Week Three: June 11th - June 15th</h5>
        <p>Finally finished A LOT of preliminary work and learning 
stuff, and got to finally write some code. (FINALLY!) I can't keep up 
with
        my own curiosity. I must learn to narrow in on the problem at 
hand and just do it.  This can be hard with near constant interruptions,
 
        meetings, etc. At first I was completely anti-VIM, a terminal 
text
        editor, but now actually VIM is starting to grow on me.  If you 
learn
        the shortcuts, it seems to be pretty fast as long as I can 
remember to
        switch in and out of modes.<br><br>
      
        After work I like to go home and surf the internet. I got a 
voter registration in the mail recently, so I am trying to catch up on 
        politics. If I get a vote, I might as well not waste it.  I'm 
not sure if I am a libertarian, but I think I might be. I've been 
        catching up on the wikileaks controversy lately, and also just 
data security in general.
         </p>        
        </li>

    <li class="four">
        <h5>Week Four: June 18th - June 22nd</h5>
        <p> Spent the first half of the week doing PMPL assignment 4, a code
        assignment. PMPL stands for Parallel Motion Planning Library.
        I learned some interesting things about refactoring code. I
        read a wrote a summary of chapter 5 of The Principles of Robot Motion.
        I'm pretty confused.  Even after some google rampage I still don't
        really understand diffeomorphisms.  Did some testing on the ACD code to
        check for bugs.  There were no bugs that I could see that weren't
        already known. <br><br>
    
        After work I am back to my usual routine of surfing the 
internet. Recently I've been making a collection of electronica with 
female
        vocals. I'm a big fan of the remix. There are a lot of artists 
that make interesting work, but don't know what they're doing with 
        respect to sound quality. A good example of this is dinky garage
 bands.  A remix can take a song that is interesting and make it 
        awesome.

        <h5>Week Five: June 25th - June 29th</h5>
        <p>
        Read a paper on genus reduction of polyhedra, worked on PMPL 
code, I'm
        enjoying the reading group. Started work on implementing the
        simplification algorithm. I've started looking at a book on how 
to deal with legacy code,
        it's something I'm rather new at.  In school we would frequently
 be given a small code base, and we would have
        to write the rest of the code to make it work.  For example, the
 beginnings of a database would be written, and I would have to 
        finish it.  In this case, the ACD code is large enough and 
complex enough that I sought extra expertise in learning
        how to add to it without introducing bugs and the like. 
        <br><br>
         I found this book:
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</a> which I thought shed some light on the topic, but it is not
        exactly like my situation.  This book talks about improving existing code, rather than adding to it.  I suppose, in 
        actuality there is no book that is going to address exactly how solve my problems, but I found it an interesting read.
        It gave me something to do after work.

        <h5>Week Six: July 2nd - July 6th</h5>
        <p>
        Read a paper on genus reduction of polyhedra, worked on PMPL code, I'm
        enjoying the reading group. Spent most of the week implementing the
        simplification algorithm.  Reading papers is starting to grow on me, I'm
        starting to like the critique part.  At first I was hesitant to try and
        critique something that I could never write at my current skill level,
        but now I like to just tear them up, looking for flaws and errors.
        Looking for flaws and errors, or things that could be expanded on in scientific papers, 
        is a great way to come up with research ideas.
        <br><br>
        Surfing the internet again.  Lately I've been reading up on 
evolutionary psychology and feminism. I've noticed these two topics are
        pretty controversial.  So I guess I'll just leave it at that.  I
 have a book lying around on the most common algorithms I've been 
        flipping through, although usually after work I don't have the 
energy to really study the book.

        <h5>Week Seven: July 9th - July 13th</h5> <p>
        I must say, the barbecue here is top-notch. I don't even like 
barbecue, but I've
        been converted, because the barbecue here is that awesome.  I 
found some
        awesome jasmine tea at the store. My days this week consist 
mostly of
        sipping tea, and debugging.  I'm getting used to using cout 
statements
        to narrow down the source of the error as opposed to using a 
debugger.
        I tried using GDB. GDB stands for GNU project debugger. It's not
 what I'm used to, but it seems to have all the required
        features of a debugger. I noticed there is some python involved 
if I want to print out certain things to the command line. 
        Since I don't actually know Python yet, I put it on my to do 
list to check it out more in depth when I had the time. I am very
        much missing using a debugger, but I feel like I should focus 
more on the assignment and less on the tools for now.  
        <br><br>
        After work I spent some time getting back into 3D animation.  I cleaned up some models for another project, kind of just
        for fun really, which prompted a google rampage on the topic.  I realized I had forgotten quite a bit of modelling 
        and what not since changing majors to computer science.  Spent a lot of time playing with shaders and rigging stuff.
        I remember in class using bump maps to create detail instead of using geometry

        <h5>Week Eight: July 16th - July 20th</h5>
        <p>
        I had never really realized before how much goes into technical writing.
        In a lot of ways it's simpler because all you have to do is state facts
        in
        a way that is efficient and descriptive.  At the same time, there are a
        lot of little conventions that I was not aware of.  For example, it is
        of utmost importance to cite information and give credit where credit is
        due. I actually think this takes the most time.  Writing the research
        paper itself is easy.
        <br><br>
        I really like a vietnamese dish called pho (pronounced "fuh") so
 I went on a quest to see if there was any pho in the neighborhood.
        There's a joint called Vietnamese Taste, which was closed, but 
theres another joint called Rosie's Pho on Texas Ave.  I'd say it 
        was okay.  It was good, but not like the pho in my neighborhood 
in Dallas.  The thing I really love about pho is that the cooks
        soak the bones in the broth. It gives the broth a really rich 
flavor.  There's a reason dogs go crazy for bone marrow, it's
         delicious. I also spent a lot of time after work this week 
looking up scientific papers to read for the reading group. We give 
little
        5 minute presentations on the paper we read each week, but 
usually we don't get to choose which paper.  Having the ability to 
choose
        a paper this time around, I spent some time looking.  I'm 
interested in the mathematical foundations of robotics, so I read a very
        interesting one on whats called the mountaineering problem. I 
like the paper, but it's probably too much for me to give a 5 minute
        speech on.

        <h5>Week Nine: July 23rd - July 27th</h5>
        <p>
        I'm starting to realize that the more I get done, the more I find there
        is to do.  For example, even though my mentor and I are getting pretty
        good results as far as reducing the overall computation time needed for
         our algorithm, a lot could be done for automating the process.  First
        of all, I don't like the amount of guesswork we're doing when trying to
        find the right input parameters. I think maybe in the future we should
        write some sort of script that will kind of brute-force it and check all
        possible input parameters for us so we can just cherry pick the ones we
        like.  This of course begs the question, if we're going to do that, why
        don't we get some parallel computing going on so that doesn't take
        forever too? 
        <br><br>
        After work I really don't do much.  I practiced my typing. I can
 type very fast.  I played with Maya (modelling and animating
        ) again.
        I have a little model that is just a pair of lips with little 
legs and arms. I'm making some blend shapes so that it will smile
        in different ways. There are some subtle things about this model
 that make me like playing with it.  Thank goodness there are some
        tacquerias around town. I am getting really tired of eating 
microwavable frozen food.  Even though there is a kitchen in the 
building
        I didn't bring any pots and pans, so I've been pretty much a 
microwave chef this entire two months.  Along with playing around in 
Maya,
        I checked out some programming challenge online.  I think when I
 get time, I'm going to do the programming challenge for
        Digital Art and Logic, and see what happens.

<li class="ten">
        <h5>Week Ten: July 30th - August 3rd</h5>
        <p>
        It's almost over.  I am looking forward to taking a break so I 
can do
        all my laundry, and go home, and take care of other things, but 
I'm
        going to miss it here. Mostly we've been agonizing over the 
research paper, 
        and practicing giving our poster presentations. I enjoy the 
work. Creating intellectual
        property in general is tedious, but I think it's rewarding in 
the end.
        There is some small satisfaction in automation, because in the 
end it is
        much less tedious than the alternative.  When I get home, I have
 made it
        my prerogative to write more code, and read more technical 
papers.  Even
        though I am majoring in computer science, I still feel like I 
just don't
        write enough code. I made it my prerogative this week to learn 
some web development skills.  Somehow in the two years I've been
        studying computer science I never learned javascript and css. 
It's not required after all, but I think it's something every programmer
        should at least know the basics. My fiance keeps telling me to 
check out
        Ruby on Rails. I don't know if I like it or not just yet.  
Usually a programming language has to grow on me.  I usually prefer
        dong things "the old way" for a little while.
